    "Among the just over 150,000 businesses in the dataset, there were 1,311 categories, which formed 44,741 unique pairs. e.g. (Restaurant, Chinese), and there were 103 businesses with no categories given. We considered transforming the data using one-hot encoding, with 0 if the category was not present and 1 if it was, but ultimately decided against it. Such an encoding scheme would result in an extremely sparse dataset, with 1,311 columns encoding categories but most businesses only having a few, which could hurt the performance of some models, and could also present issues if results for businesses with categories not present within those 1,311. As such, we decided to sentence embed the category information into a numerical vector space using a pretrained model. Due to performance considerations, we used all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to do this embedding, converting a category string into a dense 384-dimensional vector. This would allow the predictions to be generalized to categories beyond those present in the dataset, or even to just general descriptions of the business. It still capture some similarities, such as \"Restaurant\" and \"Food\", similar to how a human may perceive them when reading category information on Yelp. \n",

    "To get demographic data representing the cities, we needed to choose one of the geography levels supported by the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/dp.html). We chose to use \"place\", since it most closely aligned with our desire to use city as a representation for the customer base of a business, and would not be specifically limited to metropolitan areas. The unique numerical identifiers for places were obtained using the [Census Geocoder API](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/Geocoding_Services_API.html) with the geographical coordinates of the businesses, since those seemed to be the most reliable location information. To avoid needing to make over 150,000 API calls, we performed some limited normalization of city names and cached the result of (City, State) API calls. Although this had imperfect accuracy, since some nearby but distinct Census places with the same entered city name would be mixed, we felt that the demographic data should be similar enough that any difference was minimal. This process was performed in *place_geocoding.py*, with the resulting City, State, PlaceCode, and StateCode rows being saved as places_clean.csv. "

There were a decent number of locations missing place codes, either because the U.S. Census in 2020 had not given those areas place identifiers, or the specific geographic coordinates of the businesses happened to be outside of the bounds of the Census place, but such cases only made up a small fraction of the dataset, less than 1%, so we chose to ignore them."

    "For the dependent/response variable in our dataset, the most relevant information was the stars and review_count columns of the Yelp dataset. Since this model was built from the perspective of business owners seeking to gain insight into the suitability of prospective ideas/locations, the ideal result would be to predict business revenue and profit. However, the financial information required to do so is obviously not publicly available, and would highly depend on specifics about how individual businesses operate. As such, we attempted to approximate this information through the number and average rating(rounded to the nearest 0.5 by Yelp) of reviews."

    "The choice of ReviewScore, as a function of the number and average(rounded) rating of reviews, was somewhat arbitrary, but was based on [a previous study](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/12-016_a7e4a5a2-03f9-490d-b093-8f951238dba2.pdf) that compared restaurant Yelp information to reported revenue. The study found that indeed, a higher rating was associated with higher revenue, with about a 9% increase for a 1-star increase, and that a higher review count resulted in a greater impact of the rating. As such, we chose a Bayesian model, with a Dirichlet prior distribution representing the average of 3.75 stars and first quartile of 8, multinomial data distribution, and posterior conjugate Dirichlet distribution. This essentially means that with a low number of reviews, the ReviewScore would be close to the average rating across the dataset, 3.75 stars, and with a high number of reviews, the ReviewScore would be closer to the current rating of the business. This setup provides the benefit of having essentially the same interpretation as a typical star rating, but taking into account the number of reviews. However, it is not without limitations, as it cannot account for differing meanings of reviews among industries. Some types businesses, such as a surgical clinic, may have fewer reviews, and others, such as a cable TV company, may have worse reviews, neither of which necessarily indicate much about the performance of the business. However, given the limitations of quantifying success using only rating and review count, such limitations are essentially unavoidable.\n",

    "In *model_creation.ipynb*, we apply the Bayesian ReviewScore and scale the columns with a StandardScaler. After splitting the dataset into training and testing, we use Bayesian Optimization to select hyperparameters for an XGBoost Regressor. We also tried a basic neural network, but found it to be much slower without any improvement in results. The model had very similar performance on Training/Testing sets, indicating that it did not overfit, but had moderate overall performance, achieving a test mean absolute error of around 0.42. Interestingly, the model seems to usually get the right direction(higher or lower), but rarely makes predictions outside of the range of around [3, 4.5]. This is likely because the vast majority of the training set(and review ratings in general), tend to fall around that range."

    "Some of the ignored features are likely due to redundancy. For example, all 3 of male, female, and total population were present in the data from the Census, meaning that total population could already be known by the model just from male and female populations. Similarly, there was other information about relationship status that could have made the percentage of household that are married couples unnecessary. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, since Hawaii was not included as a valid state in the dataset, were likely close to 0 for all locations, meaning that feature had minimal predictive power. The percentages of ages being ignored are harder to explain, but notably some age group information was indeed considered by the model. There were also 98 of the total 384 text embeddings that were ignored. This is likely due to the fact that a general purpose text embedding model was used on a domain specific, fairly small set of phrases, meaning that a significant amount of the information captured by the embedding would not differ among the data(and thus provide insights)."

    "The moderate predictive accuracy of the model show that although there is some signal to be captured and insights to be drawn by considering how reviews are affected by business information and local demographics, there is quite a lot of noise and other factors remaining. This is not really surprising, one of the biggest components in a business' review score is simply the quality of its product and service, which is extremely difficult to quantify and certainly not easily able to be gathered for a large dataset. As such, a more useful metric may be \"suitability\", considering how well a certain business would match an area's demographics while accounting for variations in success due to business quality/operations and industry specific differences. This might be achieved by clustering, cosine similarity, or some other measure to group businesses, then using the predicted rating to find its quantile within that group."

    "In general, our dataset severely lacked variety of information, particularly about the specific businesses. Although some of this could be extracted from the attribute column, ideally information would be present for most or all of the businesses, and done with a standardized/objective metric. Although our model was fairly general purpose, it would likely be much more effective to specialize. For example, a restaurant-specific model may be able to much more accurately capture the impact of choices such as vegan menu offerings, whether alcohol is served, etc, compared to other restaurants other than completely unrelated businesses. It would also be ideal, though quite difficult, to consider more precise demographic data, accounting for factors such as tourism or the address surroundings."
